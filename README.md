# *Email Engagement Prediction Model*

Developed a binary classification model for predicting email engagement (ignored & read) and conducted comprehensive analysis on key impacting features.

### Components

1. *Data Preprocessing*: Utilized techniques such as categorical encoding, missing value imputation, data scaling, and data cleaning to prepare the dataset for model training.

2. *Model Building*: Implemented various algorithms including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost to build the prediction model.

3. *Model Evaluation*: Achieved optimal model performance using XGBoost with a training score of 80% and a test score of 76%.

### Dependencies

- *Scikit-learn*: For preprocessing techniques, model building, and evaluation.
- *XGBoost*: For implementing the XGBoost algorithm.
- *Pandas*: For data manipulation.
- *NumPy*: For numerical operations.

### Future Improvements

- Fine-tuning hyperparameters to potentially improve model performance.
- Exploring ensemble methods for further boosting model accuracy.
- Conducting deeper analysis on feature importance to enhance predictive power.
